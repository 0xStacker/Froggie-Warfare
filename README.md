<b>Description:</b>

  Froggie Warfare is a 2d, blockchain-backed shooting game where players take on the role of a fearless frog, battling hoards of predators in order to survive.
  The game's unique feature is the use of soulbound NFTs to represent in-game weapon assets, ensuring a truly immersive and secure gaming experience.

  * Register your game account: Currently, the game is deployed on Linea sepolia testnet, so grab some sepolia eth on Linea and
    go <a href="https://froggiewarfare.surge.sh/">here</a> to register. This is necessary to authenticate users because the game is written in Python and cannot communicate directly with wallet providers such as Metamask.

<b>Purchasing A New Weapon </b>

The weapons in the game are soulbound NFTs that can only be minted using the $CROACK meme coin on Linea. For the purpose of testing, a $CROACK token has been deployed along with the game contract on testnet. Head back to the dapp and mint some.
